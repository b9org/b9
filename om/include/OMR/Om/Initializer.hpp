/// allocated object. An Initializer is used to perform this basic
/// initialization. This initialization happens immediately after an object's
/// memory is allocated, but before the allocation is "completed".

/// Note that Objects have a complex, multi-allocation layout. There are higher
/// level APIs for constructing them. This class is for low-level, per
/// allocation initialization. Initializers may not allocate.
